Title: Predictions of 2019 City Council Elections
Date: 11.05.2019 
---

These are predictions for the 2019 Seattle City Council Election. This is based off of analysis of polls, attending candidate forums, endorsements, and fundraising. 
In the August primaries Seattle saw a 42.7% return rate - which is just slightly lower than the 2015 general election at 46.3%
As of this writing Seattle has seen about 23% of ballots returned - I imagine this will jump a lot over the final day but as SCC-Insight points out the conventional wisdom is that progressive voters tend to vote late. So, unless there is a wide margin of votes it may take up to a week to finalize counts in a district.

## District 1.
In 2015 this race was so close that it went to a recount, and Lisa Herbold ended up winning (after initially being defeated by 18 votes).
Nearly 24K people voted in that election - with 26,061 participating in the August primary.

Phil Tavel won the Seattle Times and Chamber (CASE) endorsement - but he is running such a poorly managed campaign that even strong district disfavor won't be enough to defeat the incumbent Lisa Herbold. This is a strange race - it will be close, and if anyone more likeable than Phil Tavel were running Herbold would have been defeated.

Total amount raised: $190

- Against: $75K

Total amount raised: $198
Independent
- For: $60K
- Against: $30K 

Analysis: In Primary - Herbold won 50.61 percent of vote, and Tavel won 32.25% - but Brendan Kolding finished third with 16.73%. If we simply add Kolding's vote total to Tavel's (opposition to Herbold) we get a 49/51 split. I think the general election looks similarly. The only chance Tavel has is to turn out more opposition voters and I simply don't think he has inspired people to vote for him or vote against Herbold. 

**Prediction:** 
- Herbold 51%
- Tavel 49% 

Total turnout is close to 27K 

## District 2. 
Tammy Morales gave Bruce Harrell (council president) a very strong opposition in 2015 - losing by only 400 votes. Many felt she should have won that election. When Harrell announced he wouldn't seek re-election the wisdom was that Morales would be his successor, and from the 2019 August primaries there is little to suggest she won't be. Morales has experience, is well organized, and has put in the effort to build a strong coalition in D2.

Her opponent Mark Solomon is very much a centrist - but he is also soft spoken and contemplative, and this often comes off as being uncomfortable in public speaking. He is not nearly charismatic enough to rally voters in D2, and there simply isn't a strong coalition of business voters in that district (yet) to see the strong financial support from CASE make much of a difference. Like D1 - CASE threw money at an unlikeable candidate and it won't make nearly the difference it could have. 

She won ~ 50% of the vote in the primary, and Solomon won only 23%  - Looking at the vote share there is simply no way he could make up this margin. The primary candidates who Morales defeated were in her shadow rather than his. 

An interesting note here though - Morales is the wealthiest candidate in the race. Her husband is a multi-millionaire and they live in what can only be called a mansion in D2. Challengers in the future might attack her on these lines - and an interesting analysis might be that she had dedicated herself full time to this campaing from the time of filing.

# District 3 
Whooo boy. This is one of the most contested and, to be blunt, ugly races of this election cycle. Orion is the only candidate in the election to have been accused and settled a case about campaign finance violations. 

Sawant has been attacked by nearly every PAC - her face used to rally support of people she isn't even running against. She has been painted as vindictive, self-serving, and radical in ways that are detrimental to the functioning of city council. She may be all of those things, but she is also the council's strongest opposition to the Mayor and private money. Give Sawant a lot of credit for taking her opponents, not just Orion, head on. This even garnered endorsements from fellow council members like Gonzalez who were reluctant to support her in the primaries.
  
Let's do the math from the primary first. Sawant won 36% of the vote to Orion's 21.5% ... But the primary challengers who were defeated split a lot of the opposition vote. The total number of votes garnered by Nguyen, Bowers, DeWolf, and Murakami = 13,455 - that alone is enough to defeat Sawant. The question is whether or not opposition to Sawant is strong enough that those voters are willing to support Orion.  

This is another race where the opposition candidate is simply not very likeable. Egan Orion is deceptive - he has waffled on key issues (campaign finance, safe injection, head tax) and has done nothing to ease voters fears that he is a lackey to big business. More than any other district D3 is where you would expect a big business messaging campaign to track poorly. But it hasn't. The business vote in D3 is slowly proving itself to be important in local races, and the changing demographics of D3 (e.g. tech money) are likely showing their face for the first time. The key to victory here is Orion turning out enough opposition voters to elect "anyone but Sawant" 

Sawant has gone full tilt in opposition to Amazon and CASE money. I think this works strongly in her favor. She was also saavy enough to recognize that D3 voters are feeling a pinch from rising rents and built a strong secondary messaging campaign around rent control. She may have gotten a slight bump from Sanders (his campaign even tweeted about this race) ... But Sawant has done much to damage her own image in the lead up to this race. She too has been deceptive in handling finances and she is often out of control in public forums - jumping straight into stern lectures about "Bezos" that land awkwardly. 

Had either candidate been more politically savvy - Orion during the election and Sawant before it began - this would be an easier race to call. But, it isn't and for all of the wrong reasons. Regardless of who wins this race I will bet good money neither is successful in reelection. In some ways, CASE wins even if they lose. They get to continue demonizing Sawant and the narrative of their buying an election goes away. If they win, they get Orion for four years and likely have the political strength to push for some changes they need on council. This is also a win for Durkan, who they see as a viable Mayor in a progressive city like Seattle. But, there will be a major backlash to CASE tactics. This will likely further fuel Gonzalez's push for capping private financing. There has been much criticism of Gonzalez initial plan to eliminate private money from WA elections - but that misses her bigger point. She's stoking a conversation without specifics. That is good politics even if the pundits want to know how it will be implemented in practice (and evens scoff at her initial missteps in characterizing "private"). She doesn't have to figure out the details just yet. She only needs a narrative about PAC money being a problem before it proves itself to be. Like CASE, Gonzalez actually wins even if the candidate she endorsed is defeated. The only loser here, sadly, is going to be the people of D3.

# District 4

Unlike D3 - this race has one of the savviest politicians in the race. And it is not Shawn Scott. Alex Pederson has quietly led a very successful campaign - doing it with all of the privilege that comes with being a middle aged white man who can afford to dedicate himself full time to winning a seat on the city council. Despite far left criticism for his absence at public forums - Pederson has actually knocked on every single registered voters door in D4. He has been "smart" not to put himself in public venues where the optics of himself vs Scott are so stark for voters to see. 

Scott had some early missteps but has gotten stronger as the race has gone on. He has the great disadvantage of running in D4 - a district that is old, white, and more moderate than the rest of the city. But, Scott is one of the most popular politicians in the entire race. He received more out of district democracy vouchers than any other candidate.
